## 1. <a name='setup'>Setup</a>

This is where the Owner and/or Maintainer(s) will define what needs to happen for a user to setup a development environment.

This could be defining the recommended practice for creating a virtual environment, how to spin up a test container, or any other unique process that allows contributors to easily try out any changes they wish to introduce.

## 2. <a name='submissions'>Submissions</a>

This is where the Owner and/or Maintainer(s) will define what needs to happen for a MR/PR to be accepted into the core of the repository.
